## Readme
The workspace in this repository creates the `libbdkffi` multi-language library for the Rust-based 
[bdk] library from the [Bitcoin Dev Kit] project.

Each supported language and the platform(s) it's packaged for has its own directory. The Rust code in this project is in the bdk-ffi directory and is a wrapper around the [bdk] library to expose its APIs in a uniform way using the [mozilla/uniffi-rs] bindings generator for each supported target language.

## Supported target languages and platforms
The below directories (a separate repository in the case of bdk-swift) include instructions for using, building, and publishing the native language binding for [bdk] supported by this project.

| Language | Platform              | Published Package | Building Documentation | API Docs              |
| -------- |-----------------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| Kotlin   | JVM                   | [bdk-jvm]   | [Readme bdk-jvm]       | [Kotlin JVM API Docs] |
| Kotlin   | Android               | [bdk-android] | [Readme bdk-android]   | [Android API Docs]    |
| Swift    | iOS, macOS            | [bdk-swift] | [Readme bdk-swift]     |                       |
| Python   | linux, macOS, Windows | [bdk-python] | [Readme bdk-python]    |                       |

## Building and Testing the Libraries
If you are familiar with the build tools for the specific languages you wish to build the libraries for, you can use their normal build/test workflows. We also include some [just](https://just.systems/) files to simplify the work across different languages. If you have the just tool installed on your system, you can simply call the commands defined in the `justfile`s, for example:
```sh
cd bdk-android

just build
just offlinetests
just publishlocal
```

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This library should compile with any combination of features with Rust 1.84.1.

## Contributing
To add new structs and functions, see the [UniFFI User Guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/) and the [uniffi-examples](https://thunderbiscuit.github.io/uniffi-examples/) repository.

## Goals
1. Language bindings should feel idiomatic in target languages/platforms
2. Adding new targets should be easy 
3. Getting up and running should be easy 
4. Contributing should be easy 
5. Get it right, then automate

## Using the libraries
### bdk-android
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies { 
    implementation("org.bitcoindevkit:bdk-android:<version>")
}
```

### bdk-jvm
```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies { 
    implementation("org.bitcoindevkit:bdk-jvm:<version>")
}
```

_Note:_ We also publish snapshot versions of bdk-jvm and bdk-android. See the specific readmes for instructions on how to use those.

### bdk-python
```shell
pip3 install bdkpython
```

### bdk-swift
Add bdk-swift to your dependencies in XCode.

## Developing language bindings using uniffi-rs
If you are interested in better understanding the base structure we use here in order to build your own Rust-to-Kotlin/Swift/Python language bindings, check out the [uniffi-bindings-template](https://github.com/thunderbiscuit/uniffi-bindings-template) repository. We maintain it as an example and starting point for other projects that wish to leverage the tech stack used in producing the BDK language bindings.

## Verifying Signatures
Both libraries and all their corresponding artifacts are signed with a PGP key you can find in the
root of this repository. To verify the signatures follow the below steps:

1. Import the PGP key in your keyring.
```shell
# Navigate to the root of the repository and import the ./PGP-BDK-BINDINGS.asc public key
gpg --import ./PGP-BDK-BINDINGS.asc
    
# Alternatively, you can import the key directly from a public key server
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --receive-key 2768C43E8803C6A3
    
# Verify that the correct key was imported
gpg --list-keys
# You should see the below output
pub   ed25519 2022-08-31 [SC]
    88AD93AC4589FD090FF3B8D12768C43E8803C6A3
uid           [ unknown] bitcoindevkit-bindings <bindings@bitcoindevkit.org>
sub   cv25519 2022-08-31 [E]
```

2. Download the binary artifacts and corresponding signature files.
- from [bdk-jvm]
    - `bdk-jvm-<version>.jar`
    - `bdk-jvm-<version>.jar.asc`
- from [bdk-android]
    - `bdk-android-<version>.aar`
    - `bdk-android-<version>.aar.asc`

3. Verify the signatures.
```shell
gpg --verify bdk-jvm-<version>.jar.asc 
gpg --verify bdk-android-<version>.aar.asc

# you should see a "Good signature" result
gpg: Good signature from "bitcoindevkit-bindings <bindings@bitcoindevkit.org>" [unknown]
```
