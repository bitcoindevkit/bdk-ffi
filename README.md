# Native language bindings for BDK

The workspace in this repository creates the `libbdkffi` multi-language library for the rust based 
[bdk] library from the [Bitcoin Dev Kit] project. The `bdk-ffi-bindgen` package builds a tool for 
generating the actual language binding code used to access the `libbdkffi` library.

Each supported language has its own repository that includes this project as a [git submodule]. 
The rust code in this project is a wrapper around the [bdk] library to expose it's APIs in a 
uniform way using the [mozilla/uniffi-rs] bindings generator for each supported target language.

## Supported target languages and platforms

The below repositories include instructions for using, building, and publishing the native 
language binding for [bdk] supported by this project.

| Language | Platform     | Repository   |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Kotlin   | jvm          | [bdk-kotlin] |
| Kotlin   | android      | [bdk-kotlin] |
| Swift    | iOS, macOS   | [bdk-swift]  |
| Python   | linux, macOS | [bdk-python] |

## Language bindings generator tool

Use the `bdk-ffi-bindgen` tool to generate language binding code for the above supported languages. 
To run `bdk-ffi-bindgen` and see the available options use the command:
```shell
cargo run -p bdk-ffi-bindgen -- --help
```

## Contributing

### Adding new structs and functions

See the [UniFFI User Guide](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/)

#### For pass by value objects

1. create new rust struct with only fields that are supported UniFFI types
1. update mapping `bdk.udl` file with new `dictionary`

#### For pass by reference values 

1. create wrapper rust struct/impl with only fields that are `Sync + Send`
1. update mapping `bdk.udl` file with new `interface`

## Goals

1. Language bindings should feel idiomatic in target languages/platforms
1. Adding new targets should be easy
1. Getting up and running should be easy
1. Contributing should be easy
1. Get it right, then automate
