# The default Android NDK on the ubuntu-22.04 image is 25.2.9519653
# We replace the default environment variable ANDROID_NDK_ROOT: /usr/local/lib/android/sdk/ndk/25.2.9519653
# with an older version of the NDK (21.4.7075529) using the fix proposed here: https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/5930
# For information on why this is needed at the moment see issues #242 and #243, and PR #282
