# bdk-swift

This project builds a Swift package that provides [Swift] language bindings for the
[`bdk`] library. The Swift language bindings are created by the [`bdk-ffi`] project which is included as a module of this repository.

Supported target platforms are:

- macOS, X86_64 and M1 (aarch64)  
- iOS, iPhones (aarch64)  
- iOS simulator, X86_64 and M1 (aarch64)  

## How to Use

To use the Swift language bindings for [`bdk`] in your [Xcode] iOS or macOS project add
the GitHub repository https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-swift and select one of the
release versions. You may then import and use the `BitcoinDevKit` library in your Swift
code. For example:

```swift
import BitcoinDevKit

...

```

Swift Package Manager releases for `bdk-swift` are published to a separate repository (https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-swift), and that is where the releases are created for it. 

The `bdk-swift/build-xcframework.sh` script can be used instead to create a version of the project for local testing.

### How to test

```shell
swift test
```

### Example Projects

* [BDKSwiftExampleWallet](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/BDKSwiftExampleWallet), iOS
