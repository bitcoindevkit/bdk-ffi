The idea for this crate is to leverage the bdk-ffi setup for automation related to wasm. Some ideas for what might be possible in order increasing feasability:

- Automatically generate wasm bindings and tests
- gen tests and bindings outline
- gen outline
- check that wasm bindings api mirrors ffi api

It seems like this could be a useful tool if only to check whether the wasm bindings api is up to date with the ffi api
